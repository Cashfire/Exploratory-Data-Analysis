### Course Description
This course covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data. 
These techniques are typically applied before formal modeling commences and 
can help inform the development of more complex statistical models. 
Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses 
about the world that can be addressed by the data. 
We will cover in detail the plotting systems in R as well as some of the basic principles of constructing data graphics. 
We will also cover some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data.

### Course Syllabus
After successfully completing this course you will be able to make visual representations of data 
using the `base, lattice, and ggplot2` plotting systems in R, apply basic principles of data graphics 
to create rich analytic graphics from different types of datasets, construct exploratory summaries of data 
in support of a specific question, and create visualizations of multidimensional data 
using `exploratory multivariate statistical techniques`.
